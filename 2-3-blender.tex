% history
The goal of Blender's community is to create, maintain and use a ``free and open source 3D creation suite'' that ``supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline — modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation''. 
The largest forum (https://blenderartists.org/forum/) has over 200'000 registered members, and more than a hundred different developers have committed code to the project. 
Ton Roosendaal is since 1995 the driving force behind the vision of a free software solution for the 3D pipeline. 
After having founded the animation studio NeoGeo in 1988\cite{blender-manual-history}, Ton Roosendaal and his team intended to rewrite their in-house software. 
He founded NaN (Not a Number) to develop Blender. 
NaN's business model was to provide a free 3D suite, around which they would provide services and commercial products. 
After being a success on SIGGRAPH 2000, over €4.5M have been invested by venture capitalists. 
Though having a user community over 250'000, NaN's investors decided to shut down the project due to disappointing sales and a changed economic climate. 
2002 the Blender Foundation emerged driven by Ton Roosendaal and the community, they bought the rights on Blender from the investors for €100'000 and released it under GNU GPL\cite{blender-license} in October 2002. 
The goal of the Blender Foundation is to ``find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community-based open source project.'' \cite{blender-official-history} \\

Since 2002 more than 3'000'000 lines of code have been changed in over 66'000 commits (24.11.2016) by 149 different contributors. 
During that time Blender has been extended in many fields (simulation, motion tracking, ray tracing, 3D printing, major UI redesign, …). \\

% community structure
The community is led by Ton Roosendaal who is chairman of the Blender Foundation. 

He founded the Blender Insitute in 2007. 
It's a permanent office and studio to improve Blender's development.\cite{blender-foundation-history}
The Blender Foundation pays a small team of full-time core developers to maintain Blender.\cite{blender-development-support} 
According to Blender's Homepage\cite{blender-homepage}, the community consists of ``studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists, scientists, students, VFX experts, animators, game artists, modders, [and more]''.
Artists and studios most probably use Blender for creating art, examples are still lifes, movies, VFX, games, and 3D printing.
To scientists, Blender allows manipulating their 3D scans. 
A group of archaeologists used Blender to perform a forensic facial reconstruction.\cite{blender-facial-reconstruction}
On a regular basis, Blender participates in Google Summer of Code where students are encouraged to work on Open Source software development.\cite{blender-gsoc-2016} \\

% money
Blender is mainly financed by the Blender Foundation who's goal it is to finde ways to finance Blender.
The Blender Foundation achieves this goal with a online store\cite{blender-estore}, the organisation of the yearly Blender Conference\cite{blender-conference}, the Blender Network\cite{blender-network}, the Blender Cloud\cite{blender-cloud}, crowd foundings, donations\cite{blender-donate}.
Note that this list is probably not complete since they always try new ways. 
\\

% conflicts
Blender is like a huge tool box. 
Most people just use what the need and can easily ignore parts of the software they don't need since the GUI is very customizable and flexible. 
Though, there's one issue that arises on a regular basis. 
Blender's interface has always been very pragmatic, addressing professional artists. 
With the version 2.5 where the entire interface has been redesigned, this conflict improved a lot, but it's still a steep training curve for novice users. 
This conflict escalated in the year 2013 when Andrew Price led a movement to improve Blender's user interface and make it easier to understand.\cite{blender-guru-ui} 
Ton Roosendaal finished the discussion by placing Blender's priorities and goals in the larger context.\cite{blender-ton-ui}
This also showed that Ton Roosendaal has the last say for subjects concerning Blender's development. \\

% code maintenance
Blender's source code is stored in the form of a git repository on blender.org\cite{blender-repository}.
Blender is subdivided into multiple modules; each has a developer assigned, a so-called module owner.\cite{blender-module-owners}
Most parts of the Blender source code is written in C (56\%), C++ (27\%), and Python (14\%).\cite{blender-code-stat} \\

% new features
New ideas and feature requests are normally first discussed and filtered by the community in forums or other channels like blogs, podcasts or brain-storming websites.\cite{blender-community} 
If something sounds like a good new idea and a developer can be found, the owner of the corresponding module of Blender is then contacted to check if the idea conforms to Blender's goals. 
After the requirements are set, the developer posts a design document on the wiki, describing what exactly he/she intends to implement.\cite{blender-new-devs}
Things like coding style\cite{blender-style-rules} and commit rules\cite{blender-new-devs} are well documented in Blender's wiki. 
Conforming to all guidelines, the new feature is then implemented and added to the main trunk in the form of patches. 
The new feature then develops regularly with Blender's release cycle.
