\subsection{PBRT}{Felice Serena}

% Intro, History
PBRT stands for ``Physically Based Ray Tracer''. It is a render engine that is described in the book ``Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation'' by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. They open-sourced their implementation to provide a complete application for students and researchers to study. Since it is developed for academic use, they decided to release the software under the BSD 2-Clause license. \\

% Community
The authors of the book stand at the top of the community hierarchy and make all decisions amongst them. They made it very clear that they want to keep the software close to the book. What this means is that they rarely accept pull-requests for new features. However, they encourage people to create more unit tests and scene-converters, improve portability, or push bug fixes. \cite{pbrt-pull-requests} \\

% companies
Since PBRT is so strictly governed, no companies or foundations are directly involved in its development. It is however likely that PBRT is used by some corporations internally, in the form of a fork. \\

% conflicts
Conflicts with the community are evident. The authors intend to sell their book and keep the source code close to the printed original. A big part of the community wants to build on top of the existing engine and add more features. This conflict finally resulted in a fork: LuxRender \cite{luxrender-home}. LuxRender aims to be an unbiased, physically based render engine with steady development. \\

% code
The code-base is mainly maintained by the three authors. Though the repository lists 16 other contributors. The main language is C++, git is used as version control system.
