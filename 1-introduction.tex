\section{Introduction}
Most people encountered somewhere in their life free and open source software (FOSS). But how is it possible that such projects persist although most of the time they aren't controlled by huge companies planning their development. How is it possible for a community to come together and create something new? How does such a community form? Who's interested in the development of free software? How is the quality of the final product assured? We are interested in this questions and want to find some answers by comparing three large, popular FOSS projects and three smaller ones.
