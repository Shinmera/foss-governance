\section{Introduction}
Most people have, somewhere in their life, encountered free and open source software (FOSS). But how is it possible that such projects can persist, even though most of the time they aren't controlled by huge companies planning their development? How is it possible for a community to come together and create something new? How does such a community form? Who is interested in the development of free software? How is the quality of the final product assured? We explore these questions by investigating a couple of projects, both small and large, with more and less company involvement.
