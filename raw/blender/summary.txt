Entstehung Projekt

https://www.blender.org/manual/getting_started/about/history.html: 
1988, Ton Roosendaal, animation studio NeoGeo
1995: rewrite of inhouse software -> Blender
1998: Ton found Not a Number (NaN) to develop Blender "At the core of NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross-platform 3D application for free." (open source? wer investierte? motivation?)
1999: NaN/Blender at SIGGRAPH
2000: venture capitalists: €4.5M, 250,000 users
2001: NaN failed
2002 March: Blender Foundation emerged: "The Blender Foundation’s primary goal was to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community-based open source project."
